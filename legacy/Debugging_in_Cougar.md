Debugging in Cougar
===================
{:toc}

# Launching the Application from the IDE

Create a debug profile in your IDE with the following characteristics:

| Main class |Your ```Launcher``` classs, which is in the ```launcher``` project if you used the archetype |
| VM parameters | \- |
| Program parameters | \- |
| Project/module | ```<yourService>-launcher``` |

Of course you may choose to use a non-launcher project, or create a wrapper around ```com.betfair.cougar.core.impl.Main``` if that suits you.

# Launching the Application from Maven

The ```launcher``` project was created for you by the Cougar Maven archetype.

Open up a shell window and type ```mvnDebug -P run initialize``` in the ```launcher``` project.

Maven will start a JVM but wait for you to attach a debugger on port 8000 before continuing.

# Trace logging of Requests

You might also want to [trace](Tracing_Requests_in_Cougar.html) your requests.
