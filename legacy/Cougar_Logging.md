# What Cougar Logs and Where

## Effective Configuration Log

Location: Available on JMX console under MBean "name=ApplicationProperties" as in [https://localhost:9999/ViewObjectRes//CoUGAR%3Aname%3DApplicationProperties](https://localhost:9999/ViewObjectRes//CoUGAR%3Aname%3DApplicationProperties)

Contains a dump of all the properties Cougar has been configured to use (including those of your applications and modules).

    ...
    cougar.client.log.level=INFO
    cougar.client.log.request=true
    cougar.commandProcessor.corePoolSize=5
    cougar.commandProcessor.keepAliveTime=600
    ...


## HTTP Endpoint Log

Location: Available on JMX console under MBean "name=EndPoints" as in [https://localhost:9999/ViewObjectRes//CoUGAR%3Aname%3DEndPoints](https://localhost:9999/ViewObjectRes//CoUGAR%3Aname%3DEndPoints)

Contains a dump of the endpoints available over the HTTP transport.

    RESCRIPT : Health/v2.0/getDetailedHealthStatus => http://10.20.183.161:8080/healthcheck/v2/detailed
    RESCRIPT : Health/v2.0/isHealthy => http://10.20.183.161:8080/healthcheck/v2/summary
    ...
    SOAP     : Health/v2.0/getDetailedHealthStatus => http://10.20.183.161:8080/HealthService/v2/
    SOAP     : Health/v2.0/isHealthy => http://10.20.183.161:8080/HealthService/v2/
    ...

## Server Log

Location: `<cougar.log.dir>/<system.hostname>-server.log`.

Contains Cougar framework logging (startup progress, property dump, Exceptions, shutdown info) and anything logged to a `CougarLogger`.

*Note that CougarLoggingUtils uses the System Property "cougar.log.factory" to decide which LoggingFactory to use.*

Example:

    package com.whatever;
    public class Thing {
        final static CougarLogger logger = CougarLoggingUtils.getLogger(Thing.class);
        public void logSomething(String what) {
            logger.log(Level.INFO, "%s", what);
        }
    }

This will produce the following output in the server log (assuming you passed in "Hello, World\!"):

    2011-06-23 13:14:42.130: com.whatever.Thing INFO - Hello, World!

To configure the level of a specific category in configuration:

    cougar.log.level.<logCategory>=<java.util.logging.Level>

(you can specify this in your service defaults, in an overrides file, or as a system property)

## Access Logs

Location:&nbsp;`<cougar.log.dir>/dw/<system.hostname>-access.log`.

Cougar HTTP transport creates a comma-delimited entry in the access log at the point that the HTTP response is ready to
be sent. An example for an access log entry is :

    2012-07-17 09:37:30.949,localhost-07170935-000000004f,/api/v2/creditFunds/,gzip,10.2.5.172,10.2.5.172,--,Ok,81287000,329,13,json,json,[User-Agent=Cougar Client 2.4.0]

So the following are the fields (Refer&nbsp;com.betfair.cougar.transport.impl.protocol.http.HttpRequestLogger for the relevant Java code)
# Received date-time, format yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS
# Request UUID
# Path
# Compression (gzip/none)
# User remote IP address
# User resolved IP address
# User country
# Response Code
# Process time in nanoseconds
# Number of bytes read
# Number of bytes written
# Request media sub-type
# Response media sub-type
# Extra fields (such as User-Agent) etc

## Operation Event Log (AKA 'request log')

Location: `<cougar.log.dir>/dw/<system.hostname>-request-<serviceName>.log`

A comma-delimited entry is created in the event log upon completion of each operation by the application, and before
marshalling the result back via the transport. The first fields in the log will be of the following format:

# Received date-time, format yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS
# Invocation UUID
# Service version
# Operation name
# Fault code (if there was one)
# Operation process time in nanoseconds (this does not include transport mashalling and unmarshalling time)

Application-specific fields may follow this mandatory data afterwards (see below).

### Extending the Event Log

# Implement a `com.betfair.cougar.api.LogExtension`.  The method `getFieldsToLog` returns an consistent-size
array of Objects that will be output (comma-separated) to the event log after the mandatory fields.
# Register the `LogExtension` in your service interface implementation's `init` method.  At this time you have
to specify how many fields your `LogExtension` will return.

    @Override
    public void init(ContainerContext cc) {
        this.containerContext = cc;
        cc.registerExtensionLoggerClass(MyLogExtension.class, 1);
    }

# Whenever you want to use extension logging on the request, use the `setRequestLogExtension` method on the operation's `ExecutionContext`.

    ctx.setRequestLogExtension(new MyLogExtension(thing, otherThing));

## Trace Logs

Location: `<cougar.log.dir>/<system.hostname>-trace.log`.

Please refer to [this documentation](Tracing_Requests_in_Cougar.html).

## Key Performance Indicator Log

Location: `<cougar.log.dir>/kpi/<system.hostname>-kpi.log`.

Contains entries generated by [KPI monitoring](KPI_Overview.html).

To hook a method (service interface operation or otherwise) up with KPI monitoring:

* The object should be instantiated by Spring
* Methods should use the `@KPITimedEvent` annotation

    @Override
    @KPITimedEvent(value = "ExampleServiceImpl.getSimpleResponse", catchFailures = true)
	public SimpleResponseObject getSimpleResponse(RequestContext ctx, String message) throws SimpleException {
            ...

Log entries will be made around every minute (give or take a few milliseconds).

The log entry format is a JSON object, which can contain many methods' KPIs.  Each method's KPI entry is split into time ranges, or "buckets".  Here is an example of the `ExampleServiceImpl.getSimpleResponse` method returning without Exception 59 times, 58 of those times in under 0-25ms (the time range is known bucket) and 1 in the 250-500ms range.

    2011-02-03 10:26:00.017: com.betfair.KPI INFO - \{"startTime":1296728700026,"endTime":1296728760016,"ExampleServiceImpl.getSimpleResponse.OK":\{"\[0-25.0\]":\{"avg":0.431,"ttl":25.0,"cnt":58.0,"min":0.0,"max":2.0,"dev":0.534\},"\[250.0-500.0\]":\{"avg":291.0,"ttl":291.0,"cnt":1.0,"min":291.0,"max":291.0,"dev":0.0\}\}\}

The keys are broken down as follows:

| Name | Significance |
| ---- | ------------ |
| startTime | KPI logging timeframe start time in millis (since the epoch) |
| endTime | KPI logging timeframe end time in millis (since the epoch), \~6000ms after the start time |
| avg | The average response time in this bucket (total / cnt) |
| ttl | The total response time in this bucket |
| cnt | The number of calls |
| min | The minimum response time |
| max | The maximum response time |
| dev | Presumably the deviation, not entirely sure what this signifies |

If `catchFailures` is true (the default is false), then the KPI log will distinguish between successful and failed (ie. exception thrown) invocations by using `<operationName>.OK` and `<operationName.Failed`.  Example:

    2011-02-03 10:46:00.018: com.betfair.KPI INFO - \{"startTime":1296729900030,"endTime":1296729960017,"ExampleServiceImpl.getSimpleResponse.Failed":\{"\[0-25.0\]":\{"avg":0.071,"ttl":1.0,"cnt":14.0,"min":0.0,"max":1.0,"dev":0.267\}\},"ExampleServiceImpl.getSimpleResponse.OK":\{"\[0-25.0\]":\{"avg":1.167,"ttl":7.0,"cnt":6.0,"min":1.0,"max":2.0,"dev":0.408\}\}\}

Both checked (i.e. BSIDL-defined) and unchecked (runtime) Exceptions are classified as failures by the KPI framework by default.

# Custom Event Logs

You will want to define a custom event log if you require any log with a format that you control exclusively.

## Defining the Custom Event Log

This is simplest to do using your module's Spring assembly file (`conf/cougar-application-spring.xml`).

    <bean class="com.betfair.cougar.logging.EventLogDefinition" init-method="register">
            <property name="logName" value="ADDITIONAL-LOG"/>
        <property name="registry" ref="eventLoggingRegistry"/>
        <property name="handler">
            <bean class="com.betfair.cougar.logging.handlers.TextEventLogHandler">
                    <constructor-arg value="$COUGAR{cougar.log.dir}/$COUGAR{system.hostname}-additional.log"/>
                    <constructor-arg value="$MY_APP{cougar.log.ADDITIONAL-LOG.flush}"/> <!-- true or false -->
                    <constructor-arg value="$MY_APP{cougar.log.ADDITIONAL-LOG.append}"/> <!-- true or false -->
            <constructor-arg value="$MY_APP{cougar.log.ADDITIONAL-LOG.rotation}"/> <!-- HOUR usually -->
            <constructor-arg value="false"/> <!-- this isn't an 'abstract' handler -->
            </bean>
        </property>
    </bean>

Notes:

* The 'eventLoggingRegistry' is a Spring alias.  Cougar modules use a lot of cross-module bean aliasing to wire things
together, which can be a bit confusing.
* Obviously this snippet implies that you have a `com.betfair.cougar.util.configuration.PropertyConfigurer` with a
`placeholderPrefix` of `MY_APP`, and have defined the properties `ADDITIONAL-LOG.\{flush,append,rotation\`}.
* You don't have to use the `TextEventLogHandler`, any `com.betfair.cougar.logging.handlers.AbstractEventLogHandler`
subclass will do (including any you invent).

## Logging to the Custom Event Log

# Implement a `com.betfair.cougar.api.LoggableEvent` (which also encapsulates the name of the log which the event will be recorded-to, e.g. `ADDITIONAL_LOG`)
# Whenever you want to log a custom event, use the `addEventLogRecord` method on the operation's `RequestContext`

    ctx.addEventLogRecord(new MyLoggableEvent(thing, otherThing));

## Logging an event from an interceptor

For a pre processing interceptor, you can cast the `ExecutionContext` to a `RequestContext` and invoke `addEventLogRecord` that way

For a post processing interceptor, you have to inject the correct `com.betfair.cougar.core.api.logging.EventLogger` into the place you need to log from, and use the `logEvent` methods directly.  The event logger bean you will need to inject is called `cougar.core.EventLogger`.

# Archive Suffix

The suffix used for rotating logs is `.YYYY-MM-DD-HH`.

# Changing log levels at runtime using JMX

# Go to Cougar's logging control bean at `http{`}`[s]``://localhost:9999/ViewObjectRes/CoUGAR%3Aname%3DLoggingControl`
# Fill out setLogLevel operation parameters
## p1 \-> The name of the package or fully qualified class to start logging
## p2 \-> a [JULI log level](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/logging.html), e.g. `WARNING` or `FINEST`
## p3 \-> `true` if you want the logging level change to be recursive, `false` otherwise

# Muffling Cougar logs from code

    CougarLoggingUtils.suppressAllRootLoggerOutput();

# Echoing of Cougar logs to stdout

Override: `cougar.log.echoToStdout=true`
